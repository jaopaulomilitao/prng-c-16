## Introduction

Random numbers play a crucial role in computer science, especially in fields like cryptography, simulations, and gaming. The PRNG-C-16 project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for generating random numbers in a 16-bit format. The algorithm is designed to deliver high-quality randomness while maintaining speed.

## Features

- **Fast Performance**: The PRNG operates quickly, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Statistically Strong**: It passes various statistical tests, ensuring the quality of the random numbers.
- **16-Bit Output**: Specifically designed for 16-bit integers, making it ideal for embedded systems and applications requiring compact data.
- **Long Period**: With a minimum period of \(2^{16}\), it avoids repetition for a significant number of calls.

## Installation

To get started with PRNG-C-16, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaopaulomilitao/prng-c-16.git
   cd prng-c-16
   ```

2. **Download Releases**: You can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/jaopaulomilitao/prng-c-16/releases). If you find a suitable version, download it and execute the file.

3. **Compile the Code** (if necessary):
   If you are working with C files, you may need to compile them. Use a C compiler like `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc -o prng prng.c
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the PRNG-C-16 installed, you can start using it in your projects. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Include the Header**:
   Include the PRNG header file in your C code:
   ```c
   #include "prng.h"
   ```

2. **Initialize the PRNG**:
   Before generating random numbers, initialize the PRNG:
   ```c
   prng_init(seed);
   ```

3. **Generate Random Numbers**:
   Use the following function to generate a random 16-bit integer:
   ```c
   uint16_t random_number = prng_generate();
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use the PRNG-C-16 in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "prng.h"

int main() {
    uint16_t seed = 12345; // Seed for initialization
    prng_init(seed); // Initialize PRNG

    // Generate and print 10 random numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        uint16_t random_number = prng_generate();
        printf("Random Number %d: %u\n", i + 1, random_number);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
